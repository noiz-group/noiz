### Acknowledgements

Me, Damian Kula, I would like to personally thank two people who had a significant influence on how Noiz was developed.

I would like to thank **Alexandre Kazantsev** for countless hours spent on brainstorming, consultations and validation of the Noiz.
Alex, you are the best.

General tree-like structure of how the processing is performed was inspired by **Maximilien Lehujeur** and software that he wrote during his stay at EOST that was named `labex`.
Thank you, Max!

### Funding

Initial version (up to 0.5) was developed by Damian Kula during his time at EOST, University of Strasbourg.
The first sketch of the Noiz was created in frame of collaboration between EOST, Storengy SAS and ES Geothermie.
Further developments were done in frame of collaboration between EOST and Storengy SAS.
